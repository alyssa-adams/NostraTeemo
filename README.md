# NostraTeemo
This is the repository for everything associated with NostraTeemo, from code to .png website files.
NostraTeemo is a major part of my PhD dissertation work, so all science is free and available to the public!
The reposityory is organized in the following way:

    Code: All code for collecting data to generating figures is here.
    Every code is commented and hould be self-explanitory.

    Data: All data that is collected or generated is stored here.

    Reports: All associated reports, including talks and scientific papers are stored here.

    Figures: Any figures that are for the website and reports are stored here.

This project was made possible by the brillant folks at Casseopeia and Datreants.
Casseopeia (http://cassiopeia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a wonderful Python interface to Riot's API.
The team was more than helpful in answering any questions that I had regarding Python and Cass.
Datreants (http://datreant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a smooth and intuitive data organization and retreival tool for several data files. 
It was perfect for a project of this size, and the creators were amazingly helpful in disentangling the science from the terrible work of sorting through thousands of data files. A demo of Datreants with this dataset can be found here: https://github.com/dotsdl/LOLdatreant.

THANK YOU!!! @dotsdl
